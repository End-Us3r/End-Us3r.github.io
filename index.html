	  <p> Hello, Iâ€™m James, born and raised in North Carolina, US. I'm was in college for my associates in Information Technology/Computer Programming and Web Development but <br>
		  recently transferred to WGU to earn my bachelors in software development! I cannot wait to start a career in I.T. <br> 
		  I am currently increasing my skills as a web development/computer programmer. I am interested in learning as many languages as possible. <br> 
		  So far I've worked on C++, Java, some HTML/CSS and some Python. <br>
		  C++ was my first coding language and it ignited my passion for all things IT. </p>
	   
      <p> The last few years have seen me develop a strong interest in Programming, Cybersecurity, and Robotics. <br>
          I have carried my interests with me as I went to college, first at FTCC and now at WGU, where I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in software development. <br> 
	      Also, I do my best to supplement my learning with other resources besides attending school. <br> 
	      I am constantly keeping an eye out for what else I can learn. </p>
