        <h1>A little about me!</h2>
        <p>
          Greetings from my virtual portfolio! I'm still learning how to do
          these cool things so there will be ongoing changes and additions to
          this site. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm a career transitioner doing my best to pursue my
          passions, and learning IT/tech is both gratifying and tough! I've
          worked in physical labor, construction, and commercial fishing for
          most of my life but I've always desired a more mentally stimulating
          career! 
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm passionate about learning and creating interactive media,
          such as games, websites, and artificial intelligence. I'm still a
          couple years away from finishing my bachelor's degree in software
          engineering at this time so if you're here and see some potiental or
          have some advice for me then I'm open to communication!
