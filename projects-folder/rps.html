            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This code is a C++ program that implements the game Rock-Paper-Scissors using a random number generator to simulate the computer's choice. The program prompts the user to input their choice and then displays the result of the game. The program keeps track of the number of wins, losses, and ties and displays the final score at the end of the game. The game is played until the user decides to stop playing.</p>
